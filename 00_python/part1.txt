what is programming ?
=> giving instructions to comp.(that they understand)

making a chai program :-
1) gather water
 gather milk
 gather tea leaves
 gather sugar
 gather utensils

2) enough water
 clean cups

3) then steps of making a tea(methods/functions) 
check if kettle has water
plug in kettle
boil water
get clean cups
add tea leaves and sugar and milk
pour boiled tea into cups
stir and serve

NOTE :- in the intro.py its whole function based code is written in python

onto our code base where we create many methods or properties(functions) as a whole bunch it is known as => "Class"

so basically a code is a  mixture of some class, object, properties and some methods(actions).

why Python?
-> Portable
-> Readable 
-> Productive
-> Standard Library
-> Flexible and Multi-use
