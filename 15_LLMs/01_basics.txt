🧠 What it means:

An LLM is a type of artificial intelligence model that’s trained on huge amounts of text data to understand, generate, and reason with human language.

⚙️ How it works:

It uses deep learning, specifically transformer architectures (like GPT, BERT, LLaMA, etc.).

During training, it learns patterns, grammar, facts, reasoning, and even styles from billions of words.

When you give it a prompt (like a question or instruction), it predicts the most likely continuation — that’s how it generates text.

💬 Examples of LLMs:

GPT-4 / GPT-5 (by OpenAI)

Gemini (by Google DeepMind)

Claude (by Anthropic)

LLaMA (by Meta)

Mistral, Falcon, etc.

🧩 Uses of LLMs:

Chatbots (like me 😄{ChatGPT})

Code generation (e.g., GitHub Copilot)

Summarization, translation, and writing assistants

Search enhancement and reasoning agents

AI integration in apps via APIs or SDKs

⚡ In short:

LLM = A powerful AI trained to understand and generate human-like text using massive datasets and deep learning.

-------------------------------------------

INPUT TOKENS :-
    what the user enters as a prompt is known as input tokens

OUTPUT TOKENS :-
    what the model returs as a response is known as output tokens

GPT :-
    stands for "GENERATIVE PRE-TRAINED TRANSFORMER"

    *GENERATIVE (nature) -> it is generating responses based on the inputs

    *PRE-TRAINED (basis)-> all the responses are not random, it was on the  basis of the pre trained data

    *TRANSFORMER (reality)-> all the models are actually a transformers


    --------------------------------------------------------------

    Dekh transformer kuch nhi kar raha hai bas next token ko predict karke append kar rhaa hai like --->

    yeh pehle se hai = Hey There !  
    append 1 => Hey There ! "I" (Token = I)
    append 2 => Hey There ! I "am" (Token = am)
    append 3 => Hey There ! I am "good." (Token = good.)

    because of this prediction and iteration LLMs requires GPU

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    The characters that humans use are mapped to some numbers which are    known  as TOKENS

    Different LLMs has different token system like gpt-4, gemini, Claude
