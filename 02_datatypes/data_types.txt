What is Objects ?
=> everything is object in a python code file
=> every object has its unique identity
=> every object has its unique type
=> every object has its value

Mutable and Immutable ?
mutable == changeble
immutable == not changeble

Object's identity helps us to find out is it mutable or not

NOTE : dont use value while classifying any object as mutable or not

even numbers in python is immutable
if we create two variable with same name then it will create two number memory 

we can say we cant change number but we can change the reference
